Heya! My name is Casper Eide Özdemir-Børretzen and on this site I post some posts from time to time.

In addition to this website you can also find me on the following platforms:
[GitHub](https://github.com/casper-borretzen){:target="_blank"}, [Bluesky](https://casper-borretzen.bsky.social){:target="_blank"}, [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@CasperBorretzen){:target="_blank"}, [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/CasperBorretzen){:target="_blank"} and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/conditionkill){:target="_blank"}.

I would also like to use this space to give a big thanks to [Gustavo Pezzi](https://pikuma.com/){:target="_blank"} for making absolutely amazing computer science courses that have thought me so, so much!
